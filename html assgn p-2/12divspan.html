<body>
    <p>Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. However, they serve
        different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, whereas a
        span element is used for inline organization and styling.

    <h1>The DIV Element</h1>
   <p> <div style="background-color: lightslategrey;">
        The div (division) element is a generic block-level element. We, most frequently use it to divide your page
        content into digestible blocks. A block element is a page element that starts a new line and has a width equal
        to the entire page or the parent container.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>The SPAN Element</h1>
  <p> <span style="background-color: lightgray;">
        Span is a generic inline element often used to apply styling to a portion of content . An inline element does not
        start a new line and only takes up as much space on the page as its content. Span tags are used on small
        segments of text, links, images, and other HTML elements that appear inline with the surrounding content.</span></p>
